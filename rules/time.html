      <li><span>Each team may request a maximum of two time-outs and six substitutions per set.</span></li>
      <li><span>Time-outs last for 30 seconds</span></li>
      <li><span>During all time-outs, the players in play must go to the free zone near their bench.</span></li>
      <li><span>Substitution is the act by which a player, other than the Libero or his/ her replacement player,
        after being recorded by the scorer, enters the game to occupy the position of another player, who must leave the court at that moment.</span></li>
      <li><span>A player of the starting line-up may leave the game, but only once in a set, and re-enter,
        but only once in a set, and only to his/her previous position in the line-up.</span></li>
      <li><span>A substitute player may enter the game in place of a player of the starting line-up,
        but only once per set, and he/she can only be substituted by the same starting player.</span></li>
      <li><span>A player (except the Libero) who cannot continue playing due to injury/ illness, or expulsion/disqualification should be substituted legally.</span></li>
      <li><span>An interval is the time between sets. All intervals last three minutes.</span></li>

          <li><span>If the change is not made once the leading team reaches 8 points, it will take place as soon as the
