          <li><span>The height of the next should be raised 2.43m for men and 2.24m for women (should be measured at the center of the net).</span></li>

            </ul>

          <li><span>The ball sent to the opponent's court must go over the net within the crossing space. The crossing space is the part of the vertical plane of the net limited as follows:</span></li>
            <ul class="extra_bullets">
                <li><span>below, by the top of the net;</span></li>

        <li><span>The ball that has crossed the net plane to the opponent's free zone totally or partly through the external space, may be played back within the team hits, provided that:</span></li>
          <ul class="extra_bullets">
              <li><span>the opponent's court is not touched by the player; </span></li>
              <li><span>the ball, when played back, crosses the net plane again totally or partly through the external space on the same side of the court.</span></li>
            <br></br>
          </ul>

        <li><span>The ball that is heading towards the opponent’s court through the lower space is in play until the moment it has completely crossed the vertical plane of the net.</span></li>
        <li><span>While crossing the net, the ball may touch it.</span></li>
        <li><span>A ball driven into the net may be recovered within the limits of the three, team hits.</span></li>

                    <li><span>creating an unfair advantage over the opponent by touching the net.</span></li>
                    <li><span>making actions that hinder an opponent’s legitimate attempt to play the ball.</span></li>

                      is considered in the action of playing the ball, even if no contact is made with it.</span></li>
                      <br></br>
