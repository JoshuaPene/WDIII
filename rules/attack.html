            <ul class="extra_bullets">
              <li><span>Blocking is the action of players close to the net to intercept the ball coming from the opponent by
                reaching higher than the top of the net, regardless of the height of the ball contact. </span></li>
              <li><span>Only front-row players are permitted to complete a block, but at the moment of contact with the ball, a part of the body must be higher than the top of the net.</span></li>
              <li><span>A block attempt is an action of blocking without touching the ball.</span></li>
              <li><span>A block is completed whenever the ball is touched by a blocker.</span></li>
              <li><span>A collective block is executed by two or three players close to each other and is completed when one of them touches the ball.</span></li>
              <li><span>Consecutive (quick and continuous) contacts with the ball may occur by one or more blockers, provided that the contacts are made during one action.</span></li>
              <li><span>In blocking, the player may place his/her hands and arms beyond the net, provided that this action does not interfere
                with the opponent’s play. Thus, it is not permitted to touch the ball beyond the net before an opponent has executed an attack hit.</span></li>
              <li><span>A block contact is not counted as a team hit. Consequently, after a block contact, a team is entitled to three hits to return the ball.</span></li>
              <li><span>The first hit after the block may be executed by any player, including the one who has touched the ball during the block.</span></li>
              <li><span>Blocking an opponent's service is forbidden.</span></li>

          <ul class="extra_bullets">
