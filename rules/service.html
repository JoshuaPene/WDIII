        <ul class="list_head">
          <li><span>The players must follow the service order recorded on their line-up sheet in official play.</span></li>
          <li><span>After the first service in a set, the player to serve is determined as follows:</span></li>
            <ul class="extra_bullets">
                <li><span>when the serving team wins the rally, the player (or his/her substitute) who served before, serves again;</span></li>
                <li><span>when the receiving team wins the rally,
                  it gains the right to serve and rotates before actually serving. The player who moves from the front-right position to the back-right position will serve.</span></li>
              <br></br>
            </ul>
          <li><span>In official play, the 1st referee authorizes the service, after having checked that the two teams are ready to play and that the server is in possession of the ball.</span></li>
          <br></br>
        </ul>

      <li><span><h5>Execution of Service</h5></span></li>
        <ul class="extra_bullets">
            <li><span>The ball shall be hit with one hand or any part of the arm after being tossed or released from the hand(s).</span></li>
            <li><span>Only one toss or release of the ball is allowed. Dribbling or moving the ball in the hands is permitted.</span></li>
            <li><span>At the moment of the service hit or take-off for a jump service, the server must not touch the court (the end line included) or the floor outside the service zone.</span></li>
            <li><span>After the hit, he/she may step or land outside the service zone, or inside the court.</span></li>
            <li><span>The server must hit the ball within 8 seconds after the 1st referee whistles for service</span></li>
            <li><span>A service executed before the referee's whistle is canceled and repeated.</span></li>
            <li><span>Screening is not permitted (screening is seen as the serving team blocking the flight path of the ball from the receiving team).</span></li>
            <br></br>
        </ul>


      <li><span><h5>Faults:</h5></span></li>
          <ul class="list_head">
              <li><span>The following faults lead to a change of service even if the opponent is out of position. The server:</span></li>
                <ul class="extra_bullets">
                    <li><span>violates the service order.</span></li>
                    <li><span>does not execute the service properly.</span></li>
                </ul>

                <li><span>Faults after the service hit</span></li>
                  <ul class="extra_bullets">
                      <li><span>After the ball has been correctly hit, the service becomes a fault (unless a player is out of position) if the ball:</span></li>
                        <ul class="extra_bullets">
                            <li><span>touches a player of the serving team or fails to cross the vertical plane of the net completely through the crossing space;</span></li>
                            <li><span>goes “out”;</span></li>
                            <li><span>passes over a screen.</span></li>
                        </ul>
                  </ul>
                  <br></br>
                <li><span>If the server makes a fault at the moment of the service hit
                  (improper execution, wrong rotational order, etc.) and the opponent is out of position, it is the serving fault that is sanctioned. </span></li>
                  <li><span>Instead, if the execution of the service has been correct, but the service subsequently becomes faulty
                    (goes out, goes over a screen, etc.), the positional fault has taken place first and is sanctioned. </span></li>
