        <h5><span>Warm Up <h6>(2-5 Minutes)</h6></span></h5>
          <li><span>(2-5 minutes) Begin practicing by getting your body warmed up. Jog a lap, stretch, do some quick jumps; do anything that gets your heart pumping a bit!</span></li>
          <li><span>(2-5 minutes) Give a rundown of the practice to others.</span></li>
          <li><span>(5-10 minutes) Play a downball game!</span></li>
            <br></br>
            <h6 style="text-align:left; font-weight: 800;">Downball</h6>
              <li><span>5 people on each side of the court.</span></li>
              <li><span>You will line up in a semi-circle line opened up to the net.
                (three people in the back row and two in the front row. Nobody will be in the setter position).</span></li>
              <li><span>Your goal is to successfully perform a back row attack (having the back row spike behind the midline). </span></li>
              <li><span>Once you hit a back-row attack, your team on your side will quickly rotate
                (rotate in a circle so everyone can try every position available).</span></li>
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            <br></br>

        <h5><span>Serving Progressions<h6>(10 Minutes)</h6></span></h5>
          <li><span>Serve with a partner from the backline.</span></li>
          <li><span>If there is a coach or experienced player, have them critique and help others serving.</span></li>
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            <br></br>

        <h5><span>Serving Competition <h6>(10 Minutes)</h6></span></h5>
          <li><span>Take your players and divide them into two teams</span></li>
          <li><span>Set up 10 cones on one side of the court. 5 of the cones will be for one team, and the other 5 for the other team.</span></li>
          <li><span>Put one player from each team on top of their cones (all this is doing is creating a target for servers to hit)</span></li>
          <li><span>You will have the rest of the players serve from the backline at the people in the cones.</span></li>
          <li><span>Have teams take turns serving at the cones.</span></li>
          <li><span>The goal is to serve to each cone until you have made it to each one.</span></li>
          <li><span>Every time a cone is hit at, have the players who are receiving, switch with the servers so everyone can practice aiming and serving.</span></li>
          <li><span>Do this until there is a winner, switch up teams, and repeat until satisfied.</span></li>
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            <br></br>

        <h5><span>Hitting lines vs defense <h6>(10 Minutes)</h6></span></h5>
          <li><span>Divide the teams to each side of the court.
            Roughly three people should be on the “hitting side” and everyone else should go to the “defense side.” </span></li>
          <li><span>The attacking side will set and then spike to the defenders.</span></li>
          <li><span>The defender's goal is to receive the ball and then send an attack back to the hitting side.</span></li>
          <li><span>Once the defenders hit the ball back, reset the drill and perform it again.
            Switch positions where needed and tweak where necessary. </span></li>
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            <br></br>

        <h5><span>Scrimmage or Queen/King of the Court <h6>(10-15 Minutes)</h6></span></h5>
          <li><span>A scrimmage is a little slow, so if  you want a more fast-paced game with many variations, consider Queen/King of the Court</span></li>
          <br></br>
          <h6 style="text-align:left; font-weight: 800;">Queen/King of the Court</h6>
            <li><span>Queen/King of the court is an awesome game where you split your players into teams of three.</span></li>
            <li><span>Once split into teams, play a normal rally.</span></li>
            <li><span>Play with normal rules until one team loses. Once there is a winner,
              have the losing team switch out and get replaced by another team that is waiting.</span></li>
            <li><span>Keep track of points if you want and declare a winner after 7 points and switch teams up.</span></li>
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              <br></br>

        <h5><span>Wrap up<h6>(5 Minutes)</h6></span></h5>
          <li><span>Depending on your situation, leave these five minutes to wrap up as necessary.</span></li>
