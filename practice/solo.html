        <h5><span>Start <h6>(2-5 Minutes)</h6></span></h5>
          <li><span>Begin practicing by getting your body warmed up. Jog a lap, stretch, do some quick jumps; do anything that gets your heart pumping a bit!</span></li>
          <li><span>Find a wall that will be your friend for the next hour</span></li>
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            <br></br>

        <h5><span>Serving <h6>(10-15 Minutes)</h6></span></h5>
          <li><span>You can practice serving however you’d like depending on where you are practicing, but I would recommend serving into a wall.
            If possible, mark on the wall how high the net will be that you are playing on. Try to hit above that line and be consistent.</span></li>
          <li><span>You can also serve over a net, but chasing your ball down will be annoying over time, so just choose what works best for you.</span></li>
          <li><span>Take the time to focus on you serving technique and don’t just rush through this section.</span></li>
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            <br></br>

        <h5><span>Passing <h6>(10-15 Minutes)</h6></span></h5>
          <li><span>Throw a ball into a wall and receive the ball off the rebound.
            I recommend putting a box (water bottle, etc.)  on the ground near the wall and pass to the box. </span></li>
          <li><span>Throw the ball at various heights, speeds, and angles in order to practice your agility and passing accuracy.</span></li>
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            <br></br>

        <h5><span>Setting <h6>(10-15 Minutes)</h6></span></h5>
          <li><span>Find a wall and put a mark on the wall where the top of the net would be.
            You will set the ball off the wall to the top of the line where the net is.</span></li>
          <li><span>Try not to go over the line, but just reach barely above it. That will be a
            good spot for a spiker to receive the ball.</span></li>
          <li><span>Keep doing this and vary the angle at which you are throwing the ball off the wall.
            Also, practice back setting and jump setting if you feel like you know-how.</span></li>
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            <br></br>

        <h5><span>Spiking <h6>(10-15 Minutes)</h6></span></h5>
          <li><span>Similar to serving, you will be hitting into a wall; however, step about 10-15 feet away from the wall.</span></li>
          <li><span>You will want to spike the ball above the net line and focus on the fundamentals of spiking.</span></li>
          <li><span>Practice by varying your body positions. Aim your body as if you are hitting a cross-shot or a line-shot.
            You can do this and still have the ball come back to you if you hit it correctly. </span></li>
