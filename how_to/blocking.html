      <p>There's nothing more satisfying than receiving the perfect pass for a spike and making contact on the ball so well it would make vetereans cry... oh wait, yeah there is. It's stuffing that
        perfect spike back in an attackers face. Blokcing is a necessary part of volleyball that, if done well, can score you quite a few points.
        The video below is a how to guide that explains blocking, but if you don't want to watch it, keep scrolling and there will be
        instructions for you to follow (just know, everything will be explained for right-handed hitters; but, if you are not right-handed, just switch thesteps presented to you to the left instead of right)!</p>
